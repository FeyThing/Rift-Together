Rift Together list before release.


----------------

To Add

- Add damage. Increased radiation damage the worst state you become.
- Add radiation immunity so some mobs aren't effected. (done)
- Putting moonrocks/etc or irradiated things in your inventory triggers the radiation to tick up
- All lunar creatures deal radiation damage (done)

Organization

- Organize the very unorganized configs (done)
- Reorganize messy file placement

Optional

- Nuclear winter. Radioactive snow after the first year ingame.
- Shade or taking cover under stuff protects you from the radioactive snow.
- Moving/migrating radioactive barrels floating in the water 


Compatibility

- Moonmaw_dragonfly from Uncompromising mode emits a radiation aura
- Moonglass Glommer from Cherry Forest emits an anti-radiation aura



-----------
Bugs to fix before release

- Visual bug. Radiation starts at 100% then returns back to 0% upon world update/save in caves, eat food or when you equip an item. When player rejoins

there is a bug where it is back to 100% for a split second then returns backs as appropiate percentage.
- When equipping the respirator, it loses its RadiationProtectPercent when you reload the game until you re-equip it again.

- Damage bug where things become irradiated very quickly after taking damage.

- Performance issue is mostly fixed with reduced particles but overtime I'm unsure if radiation particles will build up. If there is a way to make them disappear when off screen, it may help.

- Characters max radiation is not setting properly, and is default wilson's 100.

- When Uncompromising Mode is active and the moonmaw_dragonfly is encountered. It's radiation spreaders break the radiation particle system so players have no indicator of infected areas.
