Rift Together scripting todo list.


----------------

To Add post-release

- Increased radiation damage the worst state you become instead of a flat 1 damage tick per second.
- Putting moonrocks/etc or irradiated things in your inventory triggers the radiation to tick up


Organization

- Reorganize messy file placement


Compatibility

- Moonglass Glommer from Cherry Forest emits an anti-radiation aura


Bugs to fix 


- Performance issue is mostly fixed with reduced particles but overtime I'm unsure if radiation particles will build up. If there is a way to make them disappear when off screen, it may help.


- When Uncompromising Mode is active and the moonmaw_dragonfly is encountered. It's radiation spreaders break the radiation particle system so players have no indicator of infected areas.

Future ideas Plans


- Nuclear winter. Radioactive snow after the first year ingame.
- Shade or taking cover under stuff protects you from the radioactive snow.
- Moving/migrating radioactive barrels floating in the water
