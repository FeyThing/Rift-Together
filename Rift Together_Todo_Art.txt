Bugs to fix before release
----- Art
- Outline around art when compiling from spriter. All art needs a quick pass through textool to fix.
- Messed up original build pivots on trees. Especially noticeable when trees grow. Need to realign animations for luminous trees.
- Barrels art needs to be fixed and edited to be less crooked in a balanced way.
- Tile art too big, needs fixing.
- Misplaced bubbling animations on ponds and smelter.
