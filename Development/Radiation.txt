Radiation is the biggest hazard in Rift together for the time being. As mentioned in What is Rift Together.
Radiation is spatial in nature and comes from those lunar aligned or is spewed through rifts into the constant from a tainted source.
In this case, the toxic caves which is a rift dumping ground of toxic material that is redirected onto the surface.

- Playable characters (+modded) and mobs can become irradiated.
  Most entities have their own max radiation value.
  Most entities have their own resistance to radiation, which is a percentage reduction to radiation gain.

- Radiation states an entity can be in (alive entities only):
  * LOW - starts >37.5%, stops <35% - entity announces they feel irradiated, no other negative effects
  * MED - starts >57.5%, stops <55% - entity announces they feel sick, slight green glow
  * HIGH - starts >77.5%, stops <75% - entity announces they feel strong pain, stronger glow, irradiated overlay starts to appear,
           slight health loss (1 per 4 sec)
  * CRITICAL - starts >92.5%, stops <90% - entity announces they feel extreme pain, overlay is well visible, strong health loss (1-2 per sec)

- When a mob dies from radiation poisoning, it has a chance to mutate. In this case using current assets,
  hounds should have a chance to turn into a horror hound, pengulls into a moon pengull, and the birds into their moon-infected counterparts.
  The rest of the mutants will be custom made.

- Entities can be radiation sources (radiationsource.lua) making their radiation emission effectively infinite with variable range.
  Tiles around these entities will slowly become irradiated. Radiation sources can be removed. Tile radiation will slowly decay after the source
  has been removed. During a nuclear winter most tiles in the world will start increasing in radiation although at a lower pace.
  Air purifiers can be built to greatly increase the speed at which radiation decays in a decently large radius, nearby tiles will also be immune to
  radiation.

- Radiation can be detectable with:
  * The radiation meter, it will go up when in an irradiated area
  * Your very own eyes, when the radiation is very high the surrounding area will have a visual effect
  * Using the hazmat suit radiation vision (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

- Some items can be inherently irradiated. Keeping them in your inventory will increase radiation by a set amount.
  This effect can be mitigated by wearing protective clothing. Some foods have natural radiation values such as bananas that
  would only affect the player when eaten.
  Moonrocks should be radioactive (soft radiation source, cannot spread to tiles).

- Some creatures are naturally immune to radiation. These include the lunar aligned and robots that have extra protective shells.
  These count as soft radiation sources, cannot spread to tiles.

- Certain creatures can inflict radiation damage, these include the lunar aligned and mutants.
  These attacks have a chance to deal flat radiation damage to their opponents.
  Players can also deal radiation damage but only when highly irradiated themself (HIGH, CRITICAL).

- Various protective gear and Anti-radiation devices should be made. Radiation should eventually be weaponizable.

- Gear such as the respirator and To-Be-Madeâ„¢ haz-hat suit should require air filters that will need replacement every so often
  in order to work properly. Once this requirement is implemented the respirator should be changed to have infinite durability.


Bugs:
- There is a bug where creatures who aren't supposed to deal radiation damage, deal radiation damage, namely the robotic hounds, Robomutts possibly from their electrical bite.
- Irradiated tiles don't decay after removing the radiation source
- The radioactive barrels floating in the ocean creates infected ocean tiles in a square pattern. When it needs to be circular, it's more apparent when creating an island adventures world. Creating a world that has over 50% barrels darkens the entire game.
