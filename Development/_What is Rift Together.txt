Rift Together is a DLC sized mod expansion for Don't Starve Together. It is a open source tech mod centered on crossovers, and rifts that uses the Ratchet and Clank series as it's base crossover since it's a series whose recent plot revolves around rifts, crossover cameos and breaking through dimensions.

Otherwise Rift Together is completely original ranging from a variety of mostly original mobs, environments, and effects. Since there is an emphasize on tech, Rift Together is made to be difficult with mobs and weather both new and old tailored to combat those who do not embrace either science, the supernatural powers of the shadows or the temptation of the moon.


Is there a Story?

Yes! With dimensions being torn apart especially with the waring factions of the moon and shadow, all kinds of creatures, objects, people, and entire landmasses are finding themselves sucked up and redirected into the constant.

The radiation is spatial in nature, and aligns with that of the moon. Tears in the space and time continuality has a tendency to spew out junk and even the toxic air from various heavily polluted environments. In regards to the radiation mechanic, the source is underground and is thought to be either from space or from a sewer. The answer is both! 
While not exactly a sewer, the environment that is to be the eventually toxic caves is meant to be an origin point of why there is so much radioactive material floating around. Rifts are at some point supposed to act as a wormhole with a chance to send those at random down into the toxic caves.

Is it just about Tech?

No, Rift Together is about environmental storytelling, with a lesser extent on characters and more about how both vanilla/modded characters got there and what may had followed them through and into the constant. This leaves Rift Together a very open ended mod for expanding on it's story. Rift Together just has a heavier emphasize on science, mutants and wacky gadgets in it's current plans.
