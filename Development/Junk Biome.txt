The junk biome is by far the most important and dangerous biome. It is home to robomutt hounds, and other mechanic threats. The entire junkyard is surrounded by trash and a space that looks like someone once lived there. The junk biome is themed around locating the smelter which is supposed to belong to a future NPC you're supposed to rescue. The smelter is supposed to be closed until you meet and save the NPC. 


Currently since the NPC isn't available, the smelter is open for all players to use until the NPC is finished and implemented.

The NPC is supposed to trade and provide new blueprints that are currently found in the junkpiles for the time being.

The smelter setpiece "The lonely depot" is supposed to be dark (a type of canopy above it) and spew lavafalls in places near the smelter setpiece to give it a more grand look.
