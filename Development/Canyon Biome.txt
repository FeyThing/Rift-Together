The canyon biome is a new variation of desert. Which makes it capable of spawning and attracting dustdevils. This biome is mostly made up of randomly discarded pieces of scrap littered around due to the constant special meteor shower dumpings, and cactus. 

Some pools of water can be found in these canyons but overall it is desolate, besides the infestation of swarmers.

A mob that likes to travel in packs and eating/stealing anything off the floor. They especially fond of scrap and can become hostile depending on the season.

There needs to be new variety of rocks here.

The pillars here are none functional without purpose. Ideas is that they maybe spawn points for swarmers when the lush variant is made just to keep from purposely placing swarmer spawn in lush biomes.
